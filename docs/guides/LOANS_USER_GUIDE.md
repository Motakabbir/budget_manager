## Interest Calculations

### Simple Interest

Formula: **Total = Principal √ó (1 + Rate √ó Time)**

**Example:**
- Principal: $10,000
- Rate: 5% per year
- Time: 2 years
- **Interest = $10,000 √ó 0.05 √ó 2 = $1,000**
- **Total = $11,000**

### Compound Interest

Formula: **Total = Principal √ó (1 + Rate)^Time**

**Example:**
- Principal: $10,000
- Rate: 5% per year
- Time: 2 years
- **Total = $10,000 √ó (1.05)^2 = $11,025**
- **Interest = $1,025**

### How Payments Are Split

Each payment is automatically divided:

1. **Interest Portion**: Calculated first
2. **Principal Portion**: Remainder goes to principal
3. **Outstanding Balance**: Reduced by principal portion

**Example Payment:**
- Outstanding: $11,000 (with $1,000 interest accrued)
- Payment: $500
- Interest portion: Calculated based on current balance
- Principal portion: $500 - interest
- New outstanding: Updated automatically
