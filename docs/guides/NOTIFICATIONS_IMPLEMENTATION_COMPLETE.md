## 🔧 How It Works

### Fetching Notifications
```typescript
const { data: notifications } = useNotifications();
// Fetches all notifications, ordered by created_at DESC
```

### Marking as Read
```typescript
const { mutate: markAsRead } = useMarkNotificationAsRead();
markAsRead(notificationId);
// Updates is_read = true, sets read_at timestamp
```

### Bulk Mark as Read
```typescript
const { mutate: markAllAsRead } = useMarkAllNotificationsAsRead();
markAllAsRead();
// Marks ALL unread notifications as read
```

### Deleting Notifications
```typescript
const { mutate: deleteNotification } = useDeleteNotification();
deleteNotification(notificationId);
// Soft deletes notification
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. **Create Test Notifications** (Recommended)
To test the page with real data, create some test notifications:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
INSERT INTO notifications (user_id, type, title, message, priority, channel, is_read) VALUES
(auth.uid(), 'budget_exceeded', 'Budget Exceeded', 'You have exceeded your Groceries budget by $45. Current spending: $545/$500.', 'high', 'in-app', false),
(auth.uid(), 'unusual_spending_detected', 'Unusual Spending Detected', 'We detected unusual spending of $350 in Entertainment category. This is 120% higher than your average.', 'high', 'in-app', false),
(auth.uid(), 'low_balance_warning', 'Low Balance Alert', 'Your Chase Checking account balance is $85. Consider transferring funds to avoid overdraft fees.', 'urgent', 'in-app', false),
(auth.uid(), 'bill_reminder_today', 'Bill Due Today', 'Your Electric Bill of $125 is due today. Please make payment to avoid late fees.', 'urgent', 'in-app', false),
(auth.uid(), 'goal_milestone', 'Goal Milestone Achieved', 'Congratulations! You''ve reached 75% of your Emergency Fund goal.', 'normal', 'in-app', true),
(auth.uid(), 'credit_card_payment_due', 'Credit Card Payment Due', 'Your Visa Credit Card payment of $850 is due on November 5th.', 'high', 'in-app', false),
(auth.uid(), 'weekly_summary', 'Weekly Financial Summary', 'This week: Income $2,500, Expenses $1,200, Net $1,300. You''re 52% towards your savings goal.', 'low', 'in-app', true),
(auth.uid(), 'subscription_renewal', 'Subscription Renewal Reminder', 'Your Netflix subscription will renew on November 10th for $15.99.', 'normal', 'email', false);
```

### 2. **Implement Smart Alerts** (Optional)
Connect notification generation to your services:
- Auto-create budget alerts when spending exceeds limits
- Auto-create unusual spending alerts on transactions
- Auto-create bill reminders based on due dates

### 3. **Add Notification Sounds** (Optional)
```typescript
// Play sound on new notification
const notificationSound = new Audio('/notification.mp3');
notificationSound.play();
```

### 4. **Add Push Notifications** (Optional)
Implement browser push notifications for real-time alerts.

### 5. **Add Email/SMS Integration** (Advanced)
