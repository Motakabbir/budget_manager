## Automatic Processing

### How It Works

The system automatically checks for due recurring transactions when:
- âœ… You log into the app
- âœ… You navigate to the Recurring Transactions page
- âœ… You click the **"Process Due Now"** button

**Processing Logic:**
- Checks all **active** recurring transactions
- Identifies those where `next_occurrence <= today`
- Creates a transaction for each due recurring
- Updates the `next_occurrence` date based on frequency
- Auto-deactivates recurring that have passed their `end_date`

### Manual Processing

If you want to manually trigger the check:

1. Go to the **Recurring Transactions** page
2. Click the **"â–¶ Process Due Now"** button in the header
3. The system will:
   - Process all due transactions
   - Show a success toast: "X recurring transactions created"
   - Refresh the page data automatically

## Understanding Frequencies

### Calculation Examples

| Frequency | Interval | Example Start | Next Occurrence |
|-----------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Daily | 1 day | Jan 15 | Jan 16 |
| Weekly | 7 days | Jan 15 (Mon) | Jan 22 (Mon) |
| Bi-weekly | 14 days | Jan 15 | Jan 29 |
| Monthly | 1 month | Jan 15 | Feb 15 |
| Quarterly | 3 months | Jan 15 | Apr 15 |
| Yearly | 12 months | Jan 15, 2024 | Jan 15, 2025 |

### Monthly Equivalents

When viewing statistics, the system calculates monthly equivalents:

- **Daily**: Amount Ã— 30
- **Weekly**: Amount Ã— 4.33
- **Bi-weekly**: Amount Ã— 2.17
- **Monthly**: Amount Ã— 1
- **Quarterly**: Amount Ã— 0.33
- **Yearly**: Amount Ã— 0.08

**Example**: A $100 weekly recurring = $433/month in statistics.

## Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Set End Dates for Fixed-Term Recurring

If you know when a recurring should stop (e.g., loan payments, fixed subscriptions), set an end date. The system will auto-deactivate it when complete.

### 2. Use Descriptions for Context

Add descriptions like "Netflix Premium Plan" or "Car Loan Payment #12" to help identify transactions later.

### 3. Review Upcoming Transactions

Check the **"Upcoming Transactions (7 days)"** banner regularly to see what's coming and adjust your budget accordingly.

### 4. Deactivate Instead of Delete

If you're temporarily stopping a recurring (e.g., gym membership on hold), use **Deactivate** instead of Delete. You can easily reactivate it later.

### 5. Monitor Monthly Statistics

Use the statistics cards to understand your recurring financial commitments and ensure you have enough income to cover recurring expenses.

### 6. Execute Now for Missed Transactions

If the auto-processing missed a transaction (e.g., you were offline), use **"Execute Now"** to create it manually.

### 7. Check Transaction History

After a recurring processes, verify the created transaction in your **Expenses** or **Income** page to ensure accuracy.

## Troubleshooting

### Transaction Not Created Automatically

**Possible Causes:**
- Recurring is **inactive** (check status)
- `next_occurrence` date is in the future
- You haven't logged in since the due date
- End date has passed (check if auto-deactivated)

**Solution:**
- Activate the recurring if needed
- Click **"Process Due Now"** to manually trigger
- Use **"Execute Now"** to create immediately

### Wrong Next Occurrence Date

**Possible Causes:**
- Frequency changed but not recalculated
- Manual execution updated the schedule

**Solution:**
- Edit the recurring and verify the frequency
- Check the start date is correct
- The next occurrence recalculates automatically after each transaction

### Duplicate Transactions

**Possible Causes:**
- Clicking "Execute Now" multiple times
- Manual transaction created alongside automatic

**Solution:**
- Delete duplicate transactions from Expenses/Income page
- Wait for automatic processing instead of manual execution

### Statistics Don't Match Expectations

**Possible Causes:**
- Including inactive recurring in mental calculation
- Not accounting for monthly multipliers (e.g., weekly Ã— 4.33)

**Solution:**
- Only active recurring count toward statistics
- Review the monthly equivalent formula in this guide

## FAQ

**Q: Can I edit a transaction that was created from a recurring?**  
A: Yes! Go to the Expenses or Income page and edit it like any normal transaction. Changes won't affect the recurring template.

**Q: What happens if I delete a recurring transaction?**  
A: The template is removed, but all previously created transactions remain in your history.

**Q: Can I have multiple recurring with the same category?**  
A: Absolutely! For example, you can have multiple subscription expenses in the "Entertainment" category.

**Q: How does the system handle months with different days (e.g., 30 vs 31)?**  
A: The system uses date-fns library for smart date math. If you set a monthly recurring on Jan 31, it will create on the last day of each month (Feb 28/29, Mar 31, etc.).

**Q: Can I create a recurring that starts in the future?**  
A: Yes! Set the start date to any future date. The first transaction will be created on that date.

**Q: What if I want to skip one occurrence?**  
A: Deactivate the recurring before the due date, then reactivate it after. Or let it create automatically and delete the single transaction from your Expenses/Income page.

**Q: How do I see all transactions created from a specific recurring?**  
A: Currently, you can filter transactions by category and date range on the Expenses/Income pages. A future feature may add direct linking.
