## üöÄ How to Use New Features

### Export Your Data (Recommended!)

1. Click **Settings & Profile** in the sidebar
2. Scroll down to **Data Management** card
3. Click **Export All Data**
4. A JSON file will download with all your financial data
5. Keep this safe as a backup!

**Why?** This creates a complete backup of everything - transactions, categories, goals, budgets, and settings.

### Import/Restore Data

1. Go to **Settings & Profile**
2. Find **Data Management** card
3. Click **Import Backup File**
4. Select your previously exported JSON file
5. Confirm the import
6. Page will reload with your data restored

**Note:** Importing merges data (doesn't replace), so your existing data stays safe!

## üéØ Setting Up Recurring Transactions (Coming Soon!)

The database is ready for recurring transactions. To enable this feature:

### Step 1: Run the Migration

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Open the file: `migration_add_recurring.sql` in your project
5. Copy and paste the SQL code
6. Click **Run**

### Step 2: Use Recurring Transactions

Once the UI is built, you'll be able to:

- Set up recurring income (salary, freelance gigs)
- Set up recurring expenses (rent, subscriptions, utilities)
- Choose frequency: daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly
- Auto-create transactions on schedule
- Pause/resume recurring items

## üí° Pro Tips

### Performance

- **First Load**: Might take a second to fetch data
- **Subsequent Visits**: Lightning fast! Data is cached for 5 minutes
- **Auto-Refresh**: Data refreshes automatically when it's stale

### Notifications

- **Green** = Success (things worked!)
- **Red** = Error (something went wrong)
- **Blue** = Info (helpful information)
- **Yellow** = Warning (heads up!)

### Data Management

- **Export regularly**: Make it a monthly habit
- **Keep backups safe**: Store in cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- **Before big changes**: Always export first
- **Switching devices**: Export ‚Üí Import on new device

### Error Handling

If something breaks:

1. Try the "Return to Dashboard" button
2. Try reloading the page
3. Check your internet connection
4. Clear browser cache and retry
5. Import your latest backup if needed

## üìö Need Help?

### Common Questions

**Q: Will exporting data share it with servers?**  
A: No! Export happens entirely in your browser. The file is created locally.

**Q: Can I edit the backup JSON file?**  
A: Technically yes, but not recommended. The format must stay valid.

**Q: What happens if I import twice?**  
A: Transactions will be duplicated. Categories will be merged.

**Q: Can I schedule automatic backups?**  
A: Not yet, but it's on the roadmap!

**Q: Is my data encrypted?**  
A: Yes! It's encrypted in Supabase and uses RLS (Row Level Security).
