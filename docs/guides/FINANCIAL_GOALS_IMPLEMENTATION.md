good: 95% <= progress < 120%
behind: 80% <= progress < 95%
critical: progress < 80%
```

### Required Savings Calculation
```typescript
remainingAmount = targetAmount - currentAmount
monthsLeft = deadline - today (in months)
requiredMonthly = remainingAmount / monthsLeft
requiredWeekly = requiredMonthly / 4.33
requiredDaily = remainingAmount / daysLeft
```

### Priority Recommendations
