### Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables enforce RLS:
- **payment_cards**: Users can only view/modify their own cards
- **card_payments**: Users can only view/modify their own payments
- **transactions**: Users can only view/modify their own transactions

### React Query Hooks

**Available Hooks:**
```typescript
// Fetch hooks
usePaymentCards()          // Get all user's cards
useCardPayments()          // Get all payment records

// Mutation hooks
useCreatePaymentCard()     // Add new card
useUpdatePaymentCard()     // Update card details
useDeletePaymentCard()     // Delete card
useMakeCardPayment()       // Process payment (uses DB function)
useDeleteCardPayment()     // Delete payment record
```

**Cache Invalidation:**
- Payment mutations invalidate: `paymentCards`, `cardPayments`, `bankAccounts` queries
- Ensures real-time updates across the app

### Components Architecture

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "No cards available" in expense form**
- **Solution**: Add cards first via Cards page
- Make sure cards are marked as "active"

**2. Payment not deducting from bank account**
- **Check**: Did you select "Bank Transfer" as payment method?
- **Check**: Did you select a bank account?
- **Check**: Does bank account have sufficient balance?

**3. Available credit not updating**
- **Solution**: The `calculate_available_credit()` trigger updates this automatically
- If still not working, check database trigger is installed correctly

**4. Card utilization shows incorrect percentage**
- **Check**: Current balance is accurate
- **Check**: Credit limit is correct
- **Formula**: (Current Balance / Credit Limit) √ó 100

**5. Migration errors**
- **Check**: Bank accounts migration ran first (payment_cards references bank_accounts)
- **Check**: No duplicate column names
- **Check**: Database user has proper permissions

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify database migration ran successfully
3. Check RLS policies are enabled
4. Ensure Supabase connection is active
5. Review the [Technical Documentation](#technical-details)
