## 🧮 Key Calculation Methods

### 1. Income Statement
```typescript
Revenue (Total Income)
- Operating Expenses
= Gross Profit
- Non-Operating Expenses
= Net Income

Net Margin = (Net Income / Revenue) × 100
Growth Rate = ((Current - Previous) / Previous) × 100
```

### 2. Balance Sheet
```typescript
Current Assets:
+ Cash on Hand
+ Bank Accounts
+ Investments
= Total Current Assets

Non-Current Assets:
+ Property
+ Vehicles
+ Other Assets
= Total Non-Current Assets

Total Assets = Current + Non-Current

Current Liabilities:
+ Credit Cards
+ Short-Term Loans
= Total Current Liabilities

Long-Term Liabilities:
+ Mortgages
+ Long-Term Loans
= Total Long-Term Liabilities

Total Liabilities = Current + Long-Term

Net Worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities
Equity = Net Worth + Retained Earnings
```

### 3. Cash Flow
```typescript
Operating Cash Flow:
+ Net Income
+ Adjustments (depreciation, etc.)
= Total Operating

Investing Cash Flow:
+ Asset Sales
- Asset Purchases
+ Investment Changes
= Total Investing

Financing Cash Flow:
+ Loan Proceeds
- Loan Repayments
= Total Financing

Net Cash Flow = Operating + Investing + Financing
Ending Balance = Beginning Balance + Net Cash Flow
```

### 4. Net Worth History
```typescript
For each month:
  Calculate Balance Sheet
  Extract: Net Worth, Assets, Liabilities
  Store as data point

Result: Time-series data for charts
```

### 5. Tax Summary
```typescript
Taxable Income = Sum of taxable income categories
Deductible Expenses = Sum of deductible expense categories
Taxable Amount = Taxable Income - Deductible Expenses
Estimated Tax = Taxable Amount × Tax Rate (22% simplified)
```

const incomeStatement = ReportsCalculationService.calculateIncomeStatement(
  currentTransactions,
  previousTransactions
);

console.log('Net Income:', ReportsCalculationService.formatCurrency(incomeStatement.netIncome.net));
console.log('Profit Margin:', ReportsCalculationService.formatPercentage(incomeStatement.netIncome.margin));

```

### Example 2: Balance Sheet
```typescript
const balanceSheet = ReportsCalculationService.calculateBalanceSheet(
